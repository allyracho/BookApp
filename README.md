# BookApp
This is a final project assignment for my CMPSCI431W class. The goal was to create a whole stack project for a bookstore.  SQLite and Flask (Python) were used for the backend, and Flask (HTML/CSS) was also used for front end.

## routes.py
Included in this file is the web application's logic. Some routes include: user registration/login/logout, user profiles, book statistics and reviews. The importation of 'Books.csv' was also included in this section. 

## forms.py
Included in this file is the creation of user forms for registration and login. 

## models.py
Included in this file is the creation of all tables and relationships for our database. 

# Usage
To run this project, run 'run.py' and the server url should be displayed in the console.
